# AI Model Arena [Ideation Phase]

Welcome to the AI Model Arena! This is an early-stage prototype of a gamified platform for the community to rate and review AI models.

## The Vision

The goal is to create a fun, accessible space where anyone can share their opinions on AI models. Instead of dry, technical benchmarks, we're using a "player card" style, inspired by sports trading cards, to visualize model strengths and weaknesses.

## Current Status

This project is in the initial development phase. The basic front-end structure is being built, but features like user login, rating submission, and leaderboards are not yet implemented.
